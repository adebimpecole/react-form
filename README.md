## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Validate the form
- Sign in and log in
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to validate forms and how to use conditional rendering


```js
useEffect(()=>{
    if(props.onEnter === true){

        if(radioData.gender==""){
            getgenError("Required")
        }
        
        else{
            getgenError("")
        }
    } 

    const reset = () => {        
        props.onReset("change")
    }
    reset();
},[props.onEnter])
```

### Continued development
I plan to focus more on my use of conditional rendering, the useEffect hook and the useState hook. I also want to continue honing my knowledge of child-to-parent transfer of data.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) - This helped me in learning how to use conditional rendering. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use useEffect hooks. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
